Read group issue:
# rule of thumb: same library, same run:flowcell:lane (check fastq), same sample share the same read group (different RGs mean different batch effect in gatk recalibartion)
# The fastq file may have the information: Instrument:run:flowcell:lane
#guess read group in ALIGN.__init__():
#first line of fastq == @HWI-D00553R:33:C81PBANXX:4:1101:3209:2192 1:N:0:GTAGAGGAACTGCATA
#RGID = SAMPLE_NAME_HWI-D00553R:33:C81PBANXX:4, i.e. by removing tile:x:y==1101:3209:2192
#used in bwa mem -R "@RG\tID:RGID\tSM:SAMPLE_NAME\tPL:ILLUMINA\tLB:LIB1" (we hope the same sample is not prepared in more than one library)
